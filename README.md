# Overview
The Josephus Flavius Solver is a software tool designed to tackle the Josephus Flavius problem, a classic combinatorial challenge. This project focuses on implementing efficient algorithms to determine the survivor in a circle of soldiers after systematic eliminations.

# Problem Statement
The Josephus Flavius problem poses the following challenge:
  1. Given a circle of n soldiers numbered from 1 to n, and a fixed jump size k, soldiers are systematically eliminated in a clockwise manner.
  2. The elimination process continues until only one soldier remains.
  3. The goal is to determine the position of the last survi.

# Technologies Used
Programming Language: The solver is implemented in C++ for performance and efficiency. Algorithm Optimization: Advanced data structures and optimization techniques are employed to enhance algorithm efficiency. Testing Framework: Unit tests are conducted using [testing framework] to ensure the correctness of the solutions.
